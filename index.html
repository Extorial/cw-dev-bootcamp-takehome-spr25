            <p>Hi there! I'm Christopher Wang, a sophmore Computer Science student from Dacula, 
                Georgia. I enjoy developing programs that improve the community I'm surrounded by, 
                like the dance teacher AI I created at a hackathon to teach and correct dance 
                form by comparing it to an 
                expert's. One fun fact about is that 
                I've been enrolled in 12 different schools (including here!). I enjoy playing Table 
                Tennis, reading, and applying to internships in my free time (jk).
